# JUtils

Welcome to **JUtils**, a desktop and system tray utility application. It's built with a combination of [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a framework for building secure, and cross-platform applications, and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. The application is written in Rust and TypeScript, ensuring high performance and strong type safety.

Currently, JUtils supports only Windows operating systems fully.

## Features

JUtils offers the following features, all of which are accessible via global, system-wide hotkeys:

- **Global Microphone Toggle**: This feature allows you to toggle your microphone on and off, regardless of the application you're currently using. You can also choose to play a sound when toggling the microphone, providing clear auditory feedback.

- **Start JUtils on Startup**: You can configure JUtils to automatically start when your system boots up. This ensures that the utility is always ready to use when you need it.

- **Minimize JUtils**: If you prefer a clean taskbar, you can choose to start JUtils in a minimized state. This keeps the utility out of your way.

Stay tuned for more features in future updates!
